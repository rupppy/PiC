Description: Provides advanced algorithms for analyzing pointcloud data in
    forestry applications. Key features include fast voxelization of
    large datasets; segmentation of point clouds into forest floor,
    understorey, canopy, and wood components. The package enables
    efficient processing of large-scale forest pointcloud data, offering
    insights into forest structure, connectivity, and fire risk
    assessment. Algorithms to analyze pointcloud data (.xyz input file).
