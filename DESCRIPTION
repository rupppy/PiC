Description: Provides advanced algorithms for analyzing pointcloud data in
    forestry applications.  Key features include - Fast voxelization of
    large datasets; Segmentation of point clouds into forest floor,
    understorey, canopy, and wood components.  The package enables
    efficient processing of large-scale forest pointcloud data, offering
    insights into forest structure, connectivity, and fire risk
    assessment.  Algorithms to analyze pointcloud data (.xyz input file).
