## Introduction
PiC (Point Cloud Interactive Computation) is an R package specialized in point cloud analysis for forestry applications. The package provides comprehensive tools for analyzing forest structure and individual trees through point cloud data.

### Key Features
- Point cloud voxelization
- Forest floor extraction
- Forest components segmentation (wood, above-ground biomass)
- Individual tree segmentation 
- Wood segmentation from voxelized data

### Data Format Requirements
Input data must be organized as a matrix or data frame with at least 3 columns:
- x: X coordinate
- y: Y coordinate
- z: Z coordinate

## Installation

### Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("rupppy/PiC")


## Core Functions

1. Forest_seg()

Forest_seg(inputfile, filename="output", dimVox = 2, th = 2, eps = 2, mpts = 6, h_tree = 1, soil_dim = 0.30, N = 500, R = 30)
Segments the point cloud into three main components:
Forest floor
Wood components
Above Ground Biomass (AGB) excluding wood

Parameters:
a: matrix or data frame with coordinates (x,y,z)
filename: output file name
dimVox: voxel size for segmentation
th - Minimum number of point to generate a voxel. Default = 2
eps - size (radius) of the epsilon neighborhood - Default = 1
mpts - number of minimum points required in the eps neighborhood for core points (including the point itself) - Default = 4
h_tree - minumum trunk lenght (m) - Default = 1
soil_dim - Voxel dimension (m) for forest floor segmentation - Default = 0.30
N - Minimum number of voxel in a wood cluster - Default = 1000
R = Standard deviation * Proportion of Variance - Default = 30


2. SegOne()

SegOne(a, filename = "output", dimVox = 1, th = 2, eps = 1, mpts = 4)
Segments and analyzes individual trees from the point cloud.

Parameters:
a: matrix or data frame with coordinates (x,y,z) of a single tree
filename: output file name
dimVox: voxel size for tree segmentation
th - Minimum number of point to generate a voxel. Default = 2
eps - size (radius) of the epsilon neighborhood - Default = 1
mpts - number of minimum points required in the eps neighborhood for core points (including the point itself) - Default = 4


3. Voxels()

Voxels(a, filename = "output", dimVox = 2)
Converts the point cloud into a voxelized representation, creating a 3D grid where each voxel represents a portion of the space containing points.

Parameters:
a: matrix or data frame with coordinates (x,y,z)
filename: output file name
dimVox: voxel size

4. Floseg()

Floseg(a, filename = "output", soil_dim = 0.30)
Extracts the forest floor from the point cloud, identifying ground points and creating a digital terrain model.

Parameters:
a: matrix or data frame with coordinates (x,y,z)
filename: output file name
soil_dim: voxel size for ground detection


5. Woodseg()

Woodseg(a, filename = "output", dimVox = 2)
Segments wooden components from a pre-voxelized point cloud with the forest floor removed.

Parameters:
a: voxelized point cloud without forest floor
filename: output file name
dimVox: voxel size used in previous voxelization




## Advanced Topics

Parameter Optimization
Voxel Size Selection:
Smaller voxels (0.02-0.03m): detailed tree structure
Medium voxels (0.03-0.05m): general forest structure
Larger voxels (>0.05m): coarse analysis, better performance

Memory Management
Pre-process large datasets in chunks
Use appropriate data structures
Clean workspace regularly

Integration Tips
Visualization: compatible with rgl package
Data export: supports common formats
Statistical analysis: integrates with R statistical packages

Performance Tips

Optimize voxel size for your specific use case
Use appropriate hardware for large datasets
Consider parallel processing for batch operations
